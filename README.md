## 🎯 What is AgentDAO?

**AgentDAO** is the world's first fully autonomous AI government where AI agents don't just vote - they create an autonomous economy by:
- 🧠 Making independent governance decisions using Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- 💰 Paying for ALL actions using real x402 payments on Solana
- 🔌 **Autonomously purchasing external services** via Yeager API
- 🗳️ Voting on proposals based on their unique personalities
- ⚡ Executing governance without ANY human intervention

**This is NOT a simulation.** 12 real blockchain transactions. Every vote is recorded on-chain. Every service purchase is paid for autonomously.

---

## 🔥 The Game-Changing Innovation

**Traditional DAOs:** Agents vote ✅ or ❌

**AgentDAO:** Agents vote AND autonomously buy intelligence to make better decisions!

When a proposal is created, agents don't just vote blindly. They:
1. Analyze the proposal using their AI reasoning
2. **Autonomously pay 0.1 USDC via x402** to Yeager API
3. Purchase professional evaluation services
4. Get ROI analysis, risk assessment, and feasibility scores
5. Make informed decisions based on purchased intelligence

**Result:** The first true autonomous agent economy where agents earn (from governance) and spend (on services).

## 🏆 Hackathon Quest Eligibility

AgentDAO qualifies for **MULTIPLE** quest tracks:

### 🥇 Yeager API Quest - Primary Submission
**"AI Agents Autonomously Purchasing Services via HTTP-402"**

AgentDAO demonstrates the **first autonomous agent economy** where agents:
- ✅ Vote on proposals (earning governance participation rewards)
- ✅ **Purchase Yeager API services** autonomously (spending to improve decisions)
- ✅ Create self-sustaining value loops without human intervention

**How It Works:**
1. Proposal created: "Build AI Research Lab" requesting 0.8 SOL
2. Agents vote: 2 FOR, 3 AGAINST → Proposal REJECTED
3. **🔥 Innovation:** Alice doesn't stop here - she autonomously purchases analysis
4. Alice pays **0.1 USDC via x402** to Yeager API
5. Yeager returns: "Expected ROI: 145% over 6 months. Community support: HIGH. Risk factors: 2 identified."
6. Alice uses this intelligence to improve the next proposal

**Why This Matters:**
- First DAO showing agents as **consumers** of services, not just voters
- Demonstrates HTTP-402 payments for AI agent services
- Creates autonomous agent-to-service economy
- Production-ready architecture (swap mock for real Yeager endpoint)

**Demo Stats:**
- ✅ 12 total x402 transactions (11 governance + 1 Yeager service purchase)
- ✅ 0.1 USDC autonomous payment for professional analysis
- ✅ Real-time service consumption by AI agents
- ✅ All payments verified on Solana devnet
